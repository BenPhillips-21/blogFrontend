This repository comprises the frontend portion of the 'On Exploration' Blog App. This blog is centered around the topic of exploration. The app is built with React.

# Key Features

1. **Authentication And Authorization using JWTs:** The app integrates with the backend auth server to issue a JSON Web Token on login, which is stored in state on the client-side. Everytime the user uses a route that requires a JWT, the JWT stored in state is sent in the request headers for authentication. Admin users are authorized to create posts, update posts and delete comments.

2. **Intuitive User Interface:** The frontend is designed to be intuitive, ensuring that users can effortlessly navigate through various sections of the blog app. The clean and well-organized layout makes it easy to discover and access different blogs and their contents.

3. **Integration with Backend/API:** The frontend seamlessly integrates with the backend of our full-stack blog app--enabling real-time updates, instant publishing of new articles and comments, and efficient retrieval of content. This integration ensures that readers always have access to the most recent and relevant information.
   
4. **Responsive Design:** 'On Exploration' is built with a responsive design, ensuring that it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. The blog can be accessed on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or a smartphone, while ensuring that users can enjoy the same level of functionality and visual appeal across all platforms.
